# build-an-agent-series

## Before we get started!

### Python Setup

It is a good idea to have something to manage your python environment. pyenv is a good tool for this. I wrote a [guide](https://justinhennessy.substack.com/p/how-to-get-pyenv-up-and-running) on how to set it up.

### LangSmith Setup

LangSmith is an all-in-one developer platform for every step of the LLM-powered application lifecycle, whether youâ€™re building with LangChain or not.
Debug, collaborate, test, and monitor your LLM applications. Sign up for LangSmith [here](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith).

Here are the setup instructions for LangSmith [here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).

### LangGraph Studio Setup

LangGraph Studio offers a new way to develop LLM applications by providing a specialised agent IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of complex agentic applications

With visual graphs and the ability to edit state, you can better understand agent workflows and iterate faster. LangGraph Studio integrates with LangSmith so you can collaborate with teammates to debug failure modes.

While in Beta, LangGraph Studio is available for free to all LangSmith users on any plan tier. Sign up for LangSmith here.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio), setup instructions are there also.

### Getting an OpenAI API Key

Although you can use other LLM providers like Anthropic, Groq, and Mistral, for this series we will be using OpenAI.

To get an OpenAI API key, go to the [OpenAI API dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and click "Create new secret key".

## What we will be building?!

This repo has been created to help people who are curious about dipping their toes into the world of agentic applications. We will explore many different options which you can try out and get up and running in no time.

Here are a few areas we will be exploring:

LangChain - this is a really good starting point if you are new to build agents. LangChain is a framework to interweave the use of LLMs in your application.
LangGraph - this introduces a much more capable framework for building more complex agentic applications.

We will also build some different utiliies that might help you on your journey to building your own agentic applications.
